# Phase 1 â€” Business Process Mapping

## AS-IS
1. Walk-in or call -> manual registration on paper/legacy system.
2. Staff checks doctor availability and books slot manually.
3. No consistent reminders -> higher no-show rate.
4. Patient history scattered across systems/files.

## TO-BE
1. Patient registers via website/self-service or at desk -> Lead created in Salesforce.
2. Receptionist or auto-routing assigns doctor by specialization.
3. Patient books online; automated SMS/email reminders sent.
4. Doctor records notes in Salesforce; chronic patients get scheduled reminders and tracked metrics.
